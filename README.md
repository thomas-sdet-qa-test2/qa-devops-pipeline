## QA DevOps Pipeline  

This repository contains a CI/CD pipeline implementation for automated software testing in game development environments. The pipeline is designed to automate build validation, functional testing, and deployment verification.  

### Features  
- Automated build and test execution  
- Parallel testing on multiple environments  
- Integration with Docker and Kubernetes  
- Real-time monitoring and reporting  

### Technologies Used  
- Jenkins  
- Docker  
- Kubernetes  
- GitHub Actions  

### Project Structure  
```
qa-devops-pipeline/
│── pipeline/           # CI/CD pipeline scripts
│── configs/            # Configuration files for testing environments
│── logs/               # Pipeline execution logs
│── Jenkinsfile         # Jenkins pipeline definition
│── README.md           # Project documentation
```

### CI/CD Workflow  
1. Code is pushed to the repository  
2. Automated tests are executed using Jenkins  
3. Build artifacts are generated and stored  
4. Deployment is validated against test environments  

### Installation & Setup  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/thomas-sdet-qa-test2/qa-devops-pipeline.git  
   ```  
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash  
   docker-compose up  
   ```  
3. Run pipeline manually:  
   ```bash  
   jenkins build pipeline/Jenkinsfile  
   ```
