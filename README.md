## QA DevOps Pipeline  

Continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) setup for automated QA processes. Designed to run across multiple environments, validating application builds through functional, integration, and performance testing. Supports parallel execution with containerized test environments.  

### Key Features  
- Automated test execution triggered by code commits  
- Parallel execution of test cases across multiple environments  
- Build verification via Dockerized testing  
- Logging and reporting for failed test scenarios  
- Integration with GitHub Actions and Jenkins for automated workflows  

### Technologies  
- **Jenkins**: Orchestrates the test execution  
- **Docker**: Runs isolated test environments  
- **Selenium WebDriver**: UI automation testing  
- **pytest**: Functional and API testing  
- **Kubernetes (Optional)**: Deployment validation
